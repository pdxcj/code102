Always type "git fetch" before "git status" when checking in what's on the repo. Can use "git pull" instead.
Pull = fetch stuff from repo + merge into your local branch.
Fetch = just fetch stuff from repo (doesn't disrupt local working branch, but also doesn't update it)
Push = git won't let you if aren't working on the most recent version of what's on the repo.
git push or git push . . . assumes from/to origin unless you specify that you want it to be from upstream
Cycle: add, commit, merge, push.
fucking pwd

vi: long standing text editor. Modal editor - command line and (something else he mumbled)
